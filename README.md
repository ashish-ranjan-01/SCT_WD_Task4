# To-Do Web App  

A simple, clean and responsive To-Do list web application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Description  
This project is a lightweight web-app that allows you to manage your tasks directly in the browser. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and the list persists (if enabled) so you don’t lose data when you refresh.  
It’s built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no backend) — making it a perfect project for learning and showcasing DOM manipulation, event handling, and browser storage.

## Features  
- Add new tasks with a title (and optionally description/date if you extend it)  
- Mark tasks as **completed** and visually distinguish them from active tasks  
- Delete tasks when they’re no longer needed  
- (If implemented) Persist tasks in browser `localStorage` so that they remain after refresh  
- Responsive layout: works on desktop, tablet and mobile  
- (Optional) Filter tasks by status (All / Active / Completed) or sort them  
- (Optional future-enhancement: drag & drop reordering, due-date, tags/categories)

## Built With  
- HTML5 for structure  
- CSS3 for styling (including Flexbox/Grid and media queries for responsiveness)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for functionality and interactivity  
- (Optional) Browser `localStorage` for data persistence  

## Getting Started
